# Build Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **BuildConfig Not Found Error**
   - Error: `cannot find symbol BuildConfig.DEBUG` in FirebaseTestActivity.java
   - Fix: Replaced the BuildConfig.DEBUG reference with a runtime check using ApplicationInfo.FLAG_DEBUGGABLE

2. **Java Version Issue**
   - Error: `Dependency requires at least JVM runtime version 11. This build uses a Java 8 JVM.`
   - Fix: Updated gradle.properties to use the JDK from Android Studio:
     ```
     org.gradle.java.home=C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\\jbr
     ```

## Changes Made

1. **FirebaseTestActivity.java**:
   - Removed the direct reference to BuildConfig.DEBUG
   - Added a runtime check for debug mode using ApplicationInfo.FLAG_DEBUGGABLE
   - This approach is more reliable as it doesn't depend on the generated BuildConfig class

2. **gradle.properties**:
   - Added the JDK path to ensure Gradle uses Java 11 or newer
   - This ensures compatibility with the Android Gradle Plugin and Google Services Plugin

## Next Steps

1. **Run the app** to verify that the Firebase Test Activity works correctly
2. **Check the logs** for any remaining issues
3. **Continue with Firebase setup** as outlined in FIREBASE_FIXES.md:
   - Add your app's SHA-1 fingerprint to Firebase Console
   - Download the updated google-services.json file
   - Replace the existing file in your app directory

## Additional Notes

- The BuildConfig class is generated during the build process and is not directly available in the source code
- For future reference, if you need to access build type information, use the ApplicationInfo.FLAG_DEBUGGABLE approach
- Make sure to use Java 11 or newer for Android projects, as newer Android Gradle Plugin versions require it
