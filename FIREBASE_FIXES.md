## Changes Made

### 1. EditRecipeFragment Overhaul

#### Direct Firestore Integration
- Removed RecipeViewModel dependency completely
- Added direct Firestore queries to load and save recipes
- Implemented document ID tracking for more efficient updates
- Added proper error handling for all Firestore operations

#### Enhanced User Experience
- Added progress indicators during loading and saving
- Improved error messages with specific information
- Added UI disabling during operations to prevent multiple submissions
- Implemented better validation before saving data

#### Improved Recipe Data Handling
- Created deep copies of ingredients to avoid reference issues
- Added validation for all recipe properties before saving
- Enhanced error reporting with specific error messages
- Implemented proper document ID tracking for efficient updates

### 2. Recipe Update Logic Improvements

#### Better Update Workflow
- Added direct document updates when document ID is known
- Implemented title change handling with proper document creation and deletion
- Added fallback mechanisms when document ID is not available
- Enhanced error handling for all update scenarios

#### Efficient Document Operations
- Used document ID for direct updates when available
- Implemented query-then-update pattern when ID is not known
- Added proper transaction handling for title changes
- Improved error handling with user-friendly messages

### 3. Navigation Component Integration

#### Proper Fragment Registration
- Added RecipeDetailFragment to the navigation graph
- Created proper navigation actions between fragments
- Added arguments to fragment definitions in the navigation graph

#### NavController Usage
- Replaced direct fragment transactions with NavController navigation
- Updated all navigation code to use navigateUp() instead of popBackStack()
- Properly passed arguments between fragments using SafeArgs pattern
- Fixed fragment lifecycle issues by using proper navigation methods

## How Firebase Operations Now Work

1. **Loading Recipes**
   - The app directly queries Firestore for the recipe by title
   - It stores the document ID for more efficient updates later
   - Comprehensive error handling ensures the app doesn't crash if Firebase operations fail

2. **Updating Recipes (Same Title)**
   - If document ID is known, the app updates the document directly
   - If document ID is not known, it queries for the document first, then updates
   - All operations have proper error handling and progress indicators

3. **Updating Recipes (Title Change)**
   - The app creates a new document with the updated recipe data
   - Then it deletes the old document using its ID or by querying for it
   - Even if deletion fails, the new recipe is still saved
   - All operations have proper error handling and progress indicators

## Testing the Firebase Fixes

1. **Edit Recipe (No Title Change)**
   - Open the app and navigate to "My Recipes"
   - Select a recipe and click "Edit"
   - Make changes to the recipe (but keep the same title)
   - Save the changes
   - The app should update the recipe without crashing
   - You should see a progress indicator during the save operation
   - Verify that the changes are saved to Firebase

2. **Edit Recipe (With Title Change)**
   - Open the app and navigate to "My Recipes"
   - Select a recipe and click "Edit"
   - Change the title of the recipe
   - Save the changes
   - The app should update the recipe with the new title without crashing
   - You should see a progress indicator during the save operation
   - Verify that the old recipe is deleted and the new one is saved

3. **Edit Recipe (Offline)**
   - Put your device in airplane mode
   - Try to edit a recipe
   - The app should handle the offline state gracefully with a proper error message
   - When connectivity is restored, you should be able to edit successfully

4. **Navigation Testing**
   - Navigate between different screens in the app
   - Use the back button to return to previous screens
   - Try viewing and editing recipes multiple times
   - The app should navigate smoothly without crashes

## Additional Firebase Recommendations

1. **Implement Firebase Authentication**
   - Add user authentication for better security
   - Allow users to access their recipes from multiple devices

2. **Add Firebase Cloud Functions**
   - Implement server-side validation and processing
   - Add backup and restore functionality

3. **Enhance Offline Support**
   - Improve the app's ability to work offline
   - Add better synchronization when connectivity is restored

4. **Add Firebase Analytics**
   - Track user interactions to identify potential issues
   - Monitor app performance and stability

5. **Implement Firebase Cloud Messaging**
   - Add push notifications for important events
   - Notify users when recipes are shared with them

## Key Differences in the New Implementation

1. **Direct Firestore Access vs. ViewModel**
   - Old: EditRecipeFragment → RecipeViewModel → FirebaseService → Firestore
   - New: EditRecipeFragment → Firestore (directly)
   - Benefits: Fewer layers, less complexity, easier debugging

2. **Document ID Tracking**
   - Old: Relied on title-based queries for all operations
   - New: Stores document ID when loading for more efficient updates
   - Benefits: More efficient updates, fewer queries, better performance

3. **Progress Indicators**
   - Old: No visual feedback during operations
   - New: Progress bar and UI disabling during operations
   - Benefits: Better user experience, prevents multiple submissions

4. **Error Handling**
   - Old: Generic error messages, some operations could fail silently
   - New: Specific error messages for each operation type
   - Benefits: Easier debugging, better user feedback

5. **Navigation Implementation**
   - Old: Direct fragment transactions, not integrated with Navigation Component
   - New: Proper Navigation Component integration with NavController
   - Benefits: More reliable navigation, better back stack management, fewer crashes
